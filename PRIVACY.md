_Last Updated: February 19, 2025_

Thank you for using our Google Docs/Sheets to Outline Chrome Extension. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and what choices you have regarding your data.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

Our extension processes the following data:

### 1.1 User Content
- **Google Document/Spreadsheet Content**: When you use the extension to save a Google document or spreadsheet to Outline, we process the content of that document to convert it to Markdown format (for documents) or CSV format (for spreadsheets).
- **Document Metadata**: We process document metadata such as the document title and URL to create appropriate references in your Outline instance.

### 1.2 Configuration Data
- **Outline Instance URL**: The URL of your Outline instance where documents will be saved.
- **API Token**: Your Outline API authentication token.
- **Collection Names**: Names of collections in your Outline instance where documents will be organized.

### 1.3 Technical Data
- **Browser Information**: Basic browser information necessary for the extension to function properly.
- **Extension Settings**: Your preferences for the extension functionality.

## 2. Data Storage

### 2.1 Local Storage
- Configuration data is stored locally in your browser's storage using Chrome's `chrome.storage.sync` and `chrome.storage.local` APIs.
- No user content is permanently stored by the extension. Document content is only processed in memory during export operations.

### 2.2 Data Transmission
- User content is transmitted directly from Google's servers to your specified Outline instance.
- The extension does not transmit data to our servers.
- All communication with your Outline instance occurs over HTTPS.

## 3. Third-Party Services

### 3.1 Google Services
- This extension interacts with Google Docs and Google Sheets services to export your documents.
- Usage of these Google services is subject to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

### 3.2 Outline Wiki
- Content is sent to your self-hosted or cloud-hosted Outline instance.
- Your Outline instance's privacy practices are determined by how you or your organization has configured Outline.

## 4. Data Control and Security

### 4.1 Data Security
- The extension uses secure HTTPS connections for all data transmission.
- API tokens are stored securely using Chrome's extension storage system.
- We implement best practices for extension security to protect your data.

### 4.2 User Control
- You can remove all stored configuration data by uninstalling the extension or clearing extension storage through Chrome's extension settings.
- You can revoke the Outline API token at any time from your Outline instance.

## 5. Children's Privacy

Our extension is not designed for or directed towards children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the Chrome Web Store listing and updating the "Last Updated" date.

## 7. Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, such as:
- The right to access information we have about you
- The right to request that we delete certain information
- The right to object to processing of your information

Since this extension processes minimal data and stores it locally, most of these rights can be exercised directly through your browser's extension management.

## 8. Data Retention

Since this extension does not store document content and only maintains configuration data locally, data retention is controlled by you. Configuration data remains until you uninstall the extension or clear the extension's storage.

## 9. Open Source

This extension is open source. You can review the code to verify our privacy practices at [GitHub Repository URL].
